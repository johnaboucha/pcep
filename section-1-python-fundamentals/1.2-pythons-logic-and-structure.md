### Indentation

Spaces in other programming languages is usually ignored but in Python, it's very important. Python uses indentation to create blocks of code for functions, if statements, for loops, classes, and so on.&#x20;

```python
a = 4
b = 3
if a > b:
    print('a is larger than b')
```

Python will return an error if the code indentation is incorrect. You can use a single or more spaces for the indentation. Using four spaces is a best practice.

### Comments

Comments can be added to Python code using the hash symbol.

```python
# single line comment
print("Hello World") # another comment
```

Multi-line comments are inserted using multiple single-line comments or with triple quotes.

```python
# first comment
# second comment
print('Hello World')

"""
This is a long comment
that spans three
lines
"""
```

# 1.2 Python's Logic and Structure

### Keywords

All programming languages have a set of keywords that cannot be used as variable, class, or function names. They are what define the syntax and structure of the language. Python has 35 reserved [keywords](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical\_analysis.html#keywords) as of version 3.10.5.&#x20;

```
False      await      else       import     pass
None       break      except     in         raise
True       class      finally    is         return
and        continue   for        lambda     try
as         def        from       nonlocal   while
assert     del        global     not        with
async      elif       if         or         yield
```

### Instructions

Instructions, or statements, are what the Python interpreter executes. Statements can be simple variable assignments but they can span multiple lines as well.

Semi-colons are often used in other languages to terminate statements, but they are not required in Python. However, you can use semi-colons to separate multiple statement on a single line.

```python
a = 1

nums = 1 + 2 + 3 + \
       4 + 5 + 6 + \
       7 + 8 + 9

names = ['Toad',
         'Badger',
         'Ratty',
         'Mole']

for i in range(1,11):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)

x = 1; y = 2; z = 3
```

### Indentation

Spaces in other programming languages is usually ignored but in Python, it's very important. Python uses indentation to create blocks of code for functions, if statements, for loops, classes, and so on.&#x20;

```python
a = 4
b = 3
if a > b:
    print('a is larger than b')
```

Python will return an error if the code indentation is incorrect. You can use a single or more spaces for the indentation. Using **four spaces** is a best practice.

### Comments

Comments can be added to Python code using the hash symbol. Multi-line comments are added with triple quotes.

```python
# single line comment
print('Hello World')

"""
This is a long comment
that spans three
lines
"""
print('Hello again!')
```

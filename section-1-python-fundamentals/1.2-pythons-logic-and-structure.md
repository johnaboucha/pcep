# 1.2 Python's Logic and Structure

### Keywords

Programming languages contain reserved keywords that cannot be used as variable, class, or function names. These words are used to define the syntax and structure of the language. As of version 3.10.5, Python has 35 reserved [keywords](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical\_analysis.html#keywords).&#x20;

```
False      await      else       import     pass
None       break      except     in         raise
True       class      finally    is         return
and        continue   for        lambda     try
as         def        from       nonlocal   while
assert     del        global     not        with
async      elif       if         or         yield
```

The following sections and pages will describe the keywords you need to understand for passing the PCEP exam.

### Instructions

Instructions, or statements, are what the Python interpreter executes. Statements can be simple, single-line variable assignments, or they can span multiple lines. A backslash is required when the statement spans multiple lines.

Multi-line statements can help organize code, making it easier to read and edit. Good examples of this are the creation of lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

**Semi-colons** are not required in Python. However, you can use them to separate multiple statement on a single line.

```python
a = 1

nums = 1 + 2 + 3 + \
       4 + 5 + 6 + \
       7 + 8 + 9

names = ['Toad',
         'Badger',
         'Ratty',
         'Mole']

for i in range(1,11):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)

x = 1; y = 2; z = 3
```

{% hint style="success" %}
Remember that a backlash can serve as a line break when writing Python statements.
{% endhint %}

### Indentation

Spaces are very important in Python. Other languages might use curly brackets to create blocks of code but in Python, spaces serve that purpose instead. The indentation organizes statements into groups of code that is executed by functions, if statements, for loops, classes, and so on.&#x20;

```python
a = 4
b = 3
if a > b:
    print('a is larger than b')

while a > 0:
    a -= 1
    b += 1
    print(a + b)
```

Python will return an error if the code indentation is incorrect. You can use single or multiple spaces for indentation. Using **four spaces** is a best practice.

### Comments

Comments can be added to your Python code using the hash symbol. Multi-line comments are added with triple single, or triple double, quotes.

```python
# single line comment
print('Hello World')

"""
This is a long comment
that spans three
lines
"""
print('Hello again!')
```

# 1.4 Operators and Data Types

### Numeric Operators

Python has all the standard numeric operators. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and more. However, be aware that all integer division returns a float value.

```python
a = 1 + 2
b = 3 - 4
c = 5 * 6
d = 6 / 3 # careful, a float is returned, 2.0
e = 7 ** 8 # power
f = 9 % 2 # modulos, give the remainder here of 1
g = 9 // 2 # floor division, return 4
```

### String Operators

String concatenation occurs when to strings are added (+). Strings are repeated when the asterisk (\*) symbol is used. Pay attention when you see single integers inside strings.

```python
string1 = 'Hello'
string2 = ', World!'
print(string1 + string2) # prints Hello, World!

print('5' * 3) # prints 555
```

### Shortcut Operators

Python provides shortcut operators to assigns new values to variables. These shortcuts are available for all the numeric operators.

```python
a = 10
a += 1 # is the same as a = a + 1
a -= 1
a *= 5
a /= 2
a %= 2
a ** 2
a // 2
```

### Unary and Binary Operators

Unary operators work on a single operand.

```python
a = 1
b = 2
print(-a) # prints -1
print(+b) # prints 2
```

Binary operators work on the binary representation of the number.

```python
a = 10    # 1010
b = 7     # 0111

# & - both a AND b digits must be 1
print(a & b) # & returns 0010, prints 2

# | - OR operator
print(a | b) # returns 1111, prints 15

# ^ - XOR operator
print(a ^ b) # returns 1101, prints 13

# << - bitwise left shift
print(a << 2) # returns 101000, prints 40

# >> - bitwise right shift
print(a >> 2) # returns 10, prints 2
```

### Priorities

Python operators have an order of precedence in the same way operators do in mathematics. One mnemonic that some use is called **PEMDAS**:

```
P   Parentheses, then
E   Exponents, then
MD  Multiplication and division, left to right, then
AS  Addition and subtraction, left to right
```

Be sure to understand the order of operator precedence in Python for the exam.

1. ()
2. \*\*
3. \*, /, //, %
4. \+, -

```python
print(2 + 3 * 4) # prints 14
print(10 ** 2 + 12 // 5) # prints 102
print(15 % 2 ** 2 + 1) # prints 4
```

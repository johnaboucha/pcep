# 1.4 Operators and Data Types

### Numeric Operators

Python has addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, modulo, and floor division operators to manipulate numeric values. Note that all integer division returns a float value.

```python
a = 1 + 2
b = 3 - 4
c = 5 * 6
d = 6 / 3     # integer division outputs float, returns 2.0
e = 7 ** 8    # power, returns 5764801
f = 9 % 2     # remainder division, returns 1
g = 9 // 2    # floor division, returns 4
```

### String Operators

Perform string concatenation by adding two strings together with the **+** operator. Repeat string values with the **\*** operator. Pay attention whenever you see strings being multiplied. Single integers are treated as string characters and are repeated, not multiplied by their numeric value.

```python
string1 = 'Hello'
string2 = ', World!'
print(string1 + string2) # prints Hello, World!

print('5' * 3) # prints 555
```

Pay attention to string multiplication when you see single numbers inside strings. The result is always repeated numbers. This is good to know for the PCEP exam!

### Shortcut Operators

Use shortcut operators when assigning new values to variables. These shortcuts are available for all the numeric operators.

```python
a = 10    # initial assignment of a = 10
a += 1    # the same as a = a + 1
a -= 1    # the same as a = a - 1
a *= 5    # the same as a = a * 5 
a /= 2    # the same as a = a / 2
a %= 2    # the same as a = a % 2
a ** 2    # the same as a = a ** 2
a // 2    # the same as a = a // 2
```

### Unary Operators

Apply unary operations with the plus (+) and minus (-) symbols.

```python
a = 1
b = 2
print(-a) # prints -1
print(+b) # prints 2
```

### Order of Operations

Python operations have an order of precedence in the same way operations do in mathematics. Multiplication comes before addition, parentheses comes before division, and so on. One mnemonic that some people use to remember priority is **PEMDAS**:

```
P   Parentheses, then
E   Exponents, then
MD  Multiplication and division, left to right, then
AS  Addition and subtraction, left to right
```

1. ()
2. \*\*
3. \*, /, //, %
4. \+, -

```python
print(2 + 3 * 4)                        # prints 14
print(10 ** 2 + 12 // 5)                # prints 102
print(15 % 2 ** 2 + 1)                  # prints 4
print( (5 * 2) - (2 + 1) ** 2 + 5 // 2) # prints 3
```

Understand and be comfortable with how the order of operations work in Python for the PCEP exam.

### Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operations are used to compare or modify binary numbers. Below is a list of operators.

| Operator | Name        | Description                                         |
| -------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| &        | AND         | Returns 1 if both bits are 1.                       |
| \|       | OR          | Returns 1 if either bit is 1.                       |
| ^        | XOR         | Returns 1 if only one bit is 1.                     |
| \~       | NOT         | Inverts the value of the bits.                      |
| <<       | Left shift  | Adds 0s from the right. Leftmost bits are removed.  |
| >>       | Right shift | Adds 0s from the left. Right most bits are removed. |

```python
a = 10    # 1010
b = 7     # 0111

print(a & b) # & returns 0010, prints 2

print(a | b) # returns 1111, prints 15

print(a ^ b) # returns 1101, prints 13

print(~a) # returns -1101, prints -11

print(a << 2) # returns 101000, prints 40

print(a >> 2) # returns 10, prints 2
```

{% hint style="success" %}
Bitwise operations are a method of programming that is rarely, if ever, used in Python programming. Their presence on an entry-level programming certification exam is strange and out of place. However, study the concepts as best you can. You may see one question on the exam that asks you to perform a bitwise operation.

### Boolean Operators and Expressions

Boolean operators, also called logical operators, compare conditional statements and return a True or False boolean value.

| Operator | Description                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| and      | Returns True if both statements are True |
| or       | Returns True if either statement is True |
| not      | Returns True if the statement is False   |

```python
a = True
b = False
print(a and b)          # prints False
print(a or b)           # prints True
print(not a)            # prints False

print( 6 > 7 and 1 < 2) # prints False
```

### Relational Operators

Relational operators are used to compare values with one another. The comparison returns a True or False boolean value. They can be also combined with additional boolean operators to make more complex comparisons.

| Operator | Description              |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| ==       | Equal                    |
| !=       | Not equal                |
| >        | Greater than             |
| <        | Less than                |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to |
| <=       | Less than or equal to    |

```python
print(5 > 6) # prints False
print(5 > 6 or 5 < 6) # prints True

print(5 != 6) # prints True
print(5 != 6 and 5 <= 6) # prints True
```

### Type Casting

There may be times when you will want to convert one data type to another. For instance, a string, "5", could be cast as an integer 5 and assigned to a different variable. Casting is frequently used when working with user input or when parsing text data for numeric values.

Python includes the following built-in functions that will convert value types to another.

| Function | Description                  |
| -------- | ---------------------------- |
| int()    | Converts value to an integer |
| float()  | Converts value to a float    |
| str()    | Converts value to a string   |

```python
a = '5'
b = 3.14
c = 16

print(a * 4) # prints 5555
print(int(a) * 4) # prints 20

print(str(b) * 2) # prints 3.143.14

print(float(c)) # prints 16.0
```

Errors are returned when invalid input is used.

```python
print(int('Hello, World!')) # returns a ValueError
print(float('James Bond'))  # returns a ValueError
```

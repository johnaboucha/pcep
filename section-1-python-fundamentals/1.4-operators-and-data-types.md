# 1.4 Operators and Data Types

### Numeric Operators

Python has all the standard numeric operators. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and more. However, be aware that all integer division returns a float value.

```python
a = 1 + 2
b = 3 - 4
c = 5 * 6
d = 6 / 3 # careful, a float is returned, 2.0
e = 7 ** 8 # power
f = 9 % 2 # modulos, give the remainder here of 1
g = 9 // 2 # floor division, return 4
```

### String Operators

String concatenation occurs when to strings are added (+). Strings are repeated when the asterisk (\*) symbol is used. Pay attention when you see single integers inside strings.

```python
string1 = 'Hello'
string2 = ', World!'
print(string1 + string2) # prints Hello, World!

print('5' * 3) # prints 555
```

### Shortcut Operators

Python provides shortcut operators to assigns new values to variables. These shortcuts are available for all the numeric operators.

```python
a = 10
a += 1 # is the same as a = a + 1
a -= 1
a *= 5
a /= 2
a %= 2
a ** 2
a // 2
```

### Unary and Binary Operators

Unary operators work on a single operand.

```python
a = 1
b = 2
print(-a) # prints -1
print(+b) # prints 2
```

### Priorities

Python operators have an order of precedence in the same way operators do in mathematics. One mnemonic that some use is called **PEMDAS**:

```
P   Parentheses, then
E   Exponents, then
MD  Multiplication and division, left to right, then
AS  Addition and subtraction, left to right
```

Be sure to understand the order of operator precedence in Python for the exam.

1. ()
2. \*\*
3. \*, /, //, %
4. \+, -

```python
print(2 + 3 * 4) # prints 14
print(10 ** 2 + 12 // 5) # prints 102
print(15 % 2 ** 2 + 1) # prints 4
```

### Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operations are used to compare or modify binary numbers. Below is a list of operators.

| Operator | Name        | Description                                             |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| &        | AND         | Returns 1 if both bits are 1.                           |
| \|       | OR          | Returns 1 if either bit is 1.                           |
| ^        | XOR         | Returns 1 if only one bit is 1.                         |
| \~       | NOT         | Inverts the value of the bits.                          |
| <<       | Left shift  | Adds 0s from the right. Lets leftmost bits be removed.  |
| >>       | Right shift | Adds 0s from the left. Lets right most bits be removed. |

```python
a = 10    # 1010
b = 7     # 0111

print(a & b) # & returns 0010, prints 2

print(a | b) # returns 1111, prints 15

print(a ^ b) # returns 1101, prints 13

print(~a) # returns -1101, prints -11

print(a << 2) # returns 101000, prints 40

print(a >> 2) # returns 10, prints 2
```

Bitwise operations are a method of programming that is rarely, if ever, used in Python programming. Their presence on an entry-level programming certification exam is strange and out of place. However, study the concepts as best you can. You may see one question on the exam that covers a bitwise comparison.

### Boolean Operators and Expressions

Boolean operators compare conditional statements and return True or False.

| Operator | Description                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| and      | Returns True if both statements are True |
| or       | Returns True if either statement is True |
| not      | Returns True if statement is False       |

```python
a = True
b = False
print(a and b) # prints False
print(a or b) # prints True
print(not a) # prints False
```

### Relational Operators

Relational operators are use to compare values with one another. The comparison returns a True or False boolean value. They can be combined with additional boolean operators to make more advanced comparisons too.

| Operator | Description              |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| ==       | Equal                    |
| !=       | Not equal                |
| >        | Greater than             |
| <        | Less than                |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to |
| <=       | Less than or equal to    |

```python
print(5 > 6) # prints False
print(5 > 6 or 5 < 6) # prints True

print(5 != 6) # prints True
print(5 != 6 and 5 <= 6) # prints True
```

### Type Casting

There may be times when you will want to convert one data type to another. For instance, a string, "5", could be cast as an integer 5 and assigned to a different variable. It's often used when working with user input or when processing text data for number values.

Python includes the following built-in functions that will convert value types to another.

| Function | Description                  |
| -------- | ---------------------------- |
| int()    | Converts value to an integer |
| float()  | Converts value to a float    |
| str()    | Converts value to a string   |

```python
a = '5'
b = 3.14
c = 16

print(a * 4) # prints 5555
print(int(a) * 4) # prints 20

print(str(b) * 2) # prints 3.143.14

print(float(c)) # prints 16.0
```

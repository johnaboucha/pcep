# 1.1 Terms and Definitions

Python is a high-level language that's easy to read, write, and maintain. Python was created in 1999 by Guido van Rossum who wanted a language that was:

* easy and intuitive
* free and open source
* understandable as plain English
* suitable for everyday tasks&#x20;

Programs written in high-level languages are called **source code**. The files that contain the source code are called **source files**. Source files are simple text files

Every language has elements that make up the structure and meaning. It's important to select the elements in the right order for the program to run correctly and to have the desired output. The program may be correct in a few ways:

* **lexically** - every language has its own dictionary of words.
* **syntactically** - the structure of language rules that must be obeyed.
* **semantically** - the key words and syntax must be composed in a way that makes sense.

### Interpreting vs. Compiling

**Compilation** occurs when the source code is translated into machine code to be distributed as a single executable, such as an .exe file on Windows, or apps on the macOS App Store. The program that performs the translation is called a _compiler_. The code is compiled for specific environments and operating systems. An executable compiled for one system cannot run natively on another.

**Interpreting** occurs when the source code is translated each time the program is run. The program doing the translating is called an _interpreter_. In this case, the source code can run on any system as long as an interpreter is installed to translate the program.

The execution of compiled code is typically much faster than interpreted code. The end user of compiled applications can more easily run the programs than interpreted languages. However, interpreted languages can run on any system as long as the interpreter is installed. The code is stored using the programming language and not the executable.

Python is an **interpreted language**. The Python interpreter is needed if you wish to program and run Python on your computer.

Historically, interpreted languages have been called **scripting languages**, and the programs that use them are **scripts**.

A set of commands is known as an instruction list.

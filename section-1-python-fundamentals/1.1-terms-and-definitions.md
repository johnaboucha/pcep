# 1.1 Terms and Definitions

Python is a high-level language. It's easier to read, write, and maintain than compared with a low-level language like Assembly.&#x20;

Programs written in high-level languages are called **source code**. The files that contain the source code are called **source files**.

### Interpreting vs. Compiling

**Compilation** occurs when the source code is translated into machine code to be distributed as a single executable, such as an .exe file. The program that performs the translation is called a _compiler_. The code is compiled for specific environments and operating systems. An executable compiled for Windows cannot run natively on another system.

**Interpreting** occurs when the source code has to be translated each time the program is run. The program doing the translating in this case is called an _interpreter_. In this case, the source code can run on any system as long as an interpreter is installed to translate the program.

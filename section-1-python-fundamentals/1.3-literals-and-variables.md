# 1.3 Literals and Variables

### Boolean, integers, floating-point numbers

Python is a type-inferred language. You do not need to specify the type of variable when declaring or assigning values to it.

**Booleans** in Python can have True or False values. They can also be represented as 1 or 0, which means you can use them in operations.

```python
is_tall = False
is_short = True

print(is_tall + is_short) # returns 1
```

**Integers** are whole numbers and can be either positive or negative. Large integers can be difficult to read when there are many digits in line. Python allows the use of underscores in numeric literals to improve readability.

```python
a = 3
b = 4
population = 333_076_834
```

**Float**, or "floating point numbers", contain a decimal and can be represented by simple dot-notation or with scientific notation where "e", or "E", is used to indicate the power of 10. Floating point numbers are approximations; something to consider when using floats.

```python
pie = 3.14159

a = 1.5e3 #1500
b = 1.5E4 #15000

print(.1 + .1 + .1 == .3) # returns False
```

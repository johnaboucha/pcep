# 1.3 Literals and Variables

### Boolean, integers, floating-point numbers

Python is a type-inferred language. You do not need to specify the type of variable when declaring or assigning values to it.

**Booleans** in Python can have True or False values. They can also be represented as 1 or 0, which means you can use them in operations.

```python
is_tall = False
is_short = True

print(is_tall + is_short) # returns 1
```

**Integers** are whole numbers and can be either positive or negative. Large integers can be difficult to read when there are many digits in line. Python allows the use of underscores in numeric literals to improve readability.

```python
a = 3
b = 4
population = 333_076_834
```

**Float**, or "floating point numbers", contain decimals and can be represented by simple dot-notation or with **scientific notation** where "e", or "E", is used to indicate the power of 10. Floating point numbers are **approximations**. The output of operations may not be exactly what you expect; something to consider when using floats.

```python
pie = 3.14159

a = 1.5e3 #1500
b = 1.5E4 #15000

print(.1 + .1 + .1 == .3) # returns False
```

### Strings

Strings in Python are represented by a series of characters surrounded by single, double, or triple quotes.

Apostrophes in strings must be escaped if using single quotes around a string. They do not need to be escaped when using double-quotes.

```python
greeting = 'Hello World'
print(greeting)

greeting2 = 'My name\'s Jonas'
print(greeting2)

greeting3 = '''It
is a
wonderful day!
'''
print(greeting3)
```

Strings are like Lists in that you can access characters in the string by indexing and slicing. You can also loop through a string, get its length, and check if a string contains substring.

```python
greeting = 'Hello World'
print(greeting[0]) # prints H
print(greeting[0:5]) # prints Hello

for c in greeting:
    print(c)

length = len(greeting)

if 'W' in greeting:
    print('The string contains a "W"')
```

Strings can be created using either single or double quotes. Choose one or the other and stick with it to maintain consistency in your code. The Python community generally prefers single quotes.

### Numeral Systems

Python has support for binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal numeral systems.

**Binary numbers** are comprised of 1s and 0s and are prefixed with "0b" or "0B". It's a base-2 number system. The value 10 equals 2, 100 equals 4, 110 equals 6, and so on. For every place added, you multiply by 2 to determine the decimal value. For example:

100 translates as 4 + 0 + 0 and becomes 4.

101 translates as 4 + 0 + 1 and becomes 5.

```python
binary1 = 0b100 # 4
binary2 = 0b101 # 5

print(binary1 + binary2) # prints 9
```

**Octal numbers** are limited to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. It's a base-8 numerical system. The numbers are prefixed with "0o".

```python
octal1 = 0o07 #7
octal2 = 0o10 #8

print(octal1 + octal2) # prints 15
```

Hexadecimal numbers use sixteen digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. The numbers are prefixed with "0x".

```python
hex1 = 0x09 # 9
hex2 = 0x0A # 10

print(hex1 + hex2) # prints 19
```

Working with different numeric systems can be tricky but all you need to know for the PCEP exam is how to recognize the different systems.

### Variables

Variables are created when you assign value to them. Variable types are dynamic. Their types can change after they have been created. You can check the type by passing the variable into the type() function. Lastly, you can define variables in line if they will all be set to the same value.

```python
x = 42
name = 'Douglas Adams'
is_alive = False

x = 'Forty Two'
print(type(x)) # prints <class 'str'>

x = y = z = 5
print(x+y+z) # prints 15
```

### Naming Conventions

Python has restrictions when it comes to naming variables.

* Names must start with a letter or underscore character.
* Names cannot start with a number.
* Names can only contain alphanumeric (A-Z or a-z) and underscore characters (\_).
* Names are case sensitive. YEAR is not equal to year.&#x20;

The Python community has additional preferences for variables names.

* Use names that make sense. For example, temperature instead of t.
* Use snake\_case instead of camelCase.
* Use uppercase when defining constants.

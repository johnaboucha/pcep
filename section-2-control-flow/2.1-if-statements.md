# 2.1 If Statements

The **if-statement** tests whether a condition is True. If the condition is True, the inner code block is executed.

```python
a = 4
b = 5

if a < b:
    print('a is less than b')
```

The **elif-statement** tests whether another condition is True if the previous conditions are False. Multiple elif-statement can be strung together.

```python
a = 6
b = 5

if a < b:
    print('a is less than b')
elif a > b:
    print('a is not less than b')
elif a == b:
    print('a is equal to b')
```

The **else-statement** executes if all the preceding if statements are False. The else and elif-statements are **optional**.

```python
a = 5
b = 5

if a < b:
    print('a is less than b')
elif a > b:
    print('a is not less than b')
else:
    print('a must be equal to b')
```

### Multiple Conditional Statements

Multiple condition statements can be used together with boolean operators _and_ and _or_ and parentheses to create more complex conditionals.

```python
a = 2
b = 3

if a > 0 and a < 10:
    print('a is a positive number that\'s less than 10')
    
if (a > b or a > 0) and b * 4 > 10:
    print('success')
```

Be comfortable with multiple condition statements. There will likely be one or more on the PCEP exam.

### Nested If-Statements

If-statements can be nested inside other if-statements. Nested statements are useful when you want to test additional conditional statements if the first condition is True.

```python
age = 123

if age > 18: # is person an adult
    if age > 60:
        print('This is an old adult')
    elif age > 40:
        print('This is a middle-age adult')
    else:
        print('This is a young adult')
```

# 2.2 Loops and Iterations

### The Pass Instruction

The pass statement is used as a placeholder for code that has not yet been implemented. The inner blocks of code for If statements and loops must have code inside in order for a Python script to run without an error.

There may be times when you still want to run the script.

Use pass.

```python
if 1 < 88:
    pass

def connect_to_db():
    pass

for n in range(1,11):
    pass
```

### Building Loops

The **while loop** keeps repeating until a condition is no longer True. You can add an else-statement at the end of a while loop to execute once the condition is False.

```python
i = 4
while i >= 1:
    print(i)
    i -= 1

i = 4
while i >= 1:
    print(i)
    i -= 1
else:
    print('i is less than 1') # this line would always print
```

A **for loop** is used to iterate over a sequence of values, which may be a range of numbers, elements in a List, or the characters in a string. The in keyword is needed

```python
names = ['Toad', 'Badger', 'Ratty', 'Mole']
for name in names:
    print(name)

for n in names[0]:     # iterate over the letters in 'Toad'
    print(n)
```

The **range function** creates a sequence of numbers, which can be iterated over with a for loop. The sequence starts at 0 and iterates by 1 as the default behavior. The syntax is:

range_(stop_)

```python
for n in range(6):
    print(n)
```

Range also accepts start and end parameters to give you more control over the sequencing. The syntax is:

range_(start, stop, step_)

```python
for n in range(10, 21, 2):
    print(n)
```

A **break statement** can be used to stop a loop before it finishes iterating.

```python
names = ['Toad', 'Badger', 'Ratty', 'Mole']
for name in names:
    if name == 'Badger':
        print(name)
        break
```

A **continue statement** is similar to a break but instead of stopping the loop, it stops the current iteration and continues with the next iteration.

```python
names = ['Toad', 'Badger', 'Ratty', 'Mole']
for name in names:
    if name == 'Badger':
        continue
    print(name)
```

The else statement can be appended to the end of for loops. The else statement always executes once the for statement is finished.

```python
names = ['Toad', 'Badger', 'Ratty', 'Mole']
for name in names:
    if name == 'Badger':
        continue
    print(name)
else:
    print('Done with looping')
```

Be sure to study the format and structure of loop statements for the PCEP exam. What order do the keywords and elements appear? Where does the indentation occur?

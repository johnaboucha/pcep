# Loops and Iterations

### The Pass Instruction

The pass statement is used as a placeholder for code that has not yet been implemented. The inner blocks of code for If statements and loops must have code inside in order for a Python script to run without an error.

There may be times when you still want to run the script.

Use pass.

```python
if 1 < 88:
    pass

def connect_to_db():
    pass

for n in range(1,11):
    pass
```

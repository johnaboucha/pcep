# 3.2 Tuples

Tuples are another data structure in Python. They are very smilier to lists but with some subtle differences. Tuples are immutable. You cannot add or remove items once the tuple is created. Tuples are recognized by values surround by parentheses.

```python
tuple1 = 1,
tuple2 = (1,)
tuple3 = (1,2,3)

# create new tuple by adding elements from other tuples
tuple4 = tuple1 + tuple2 + tuple3

for item in tuple4:
    print(item)
```

Tuples share many similarities with lists. They can be indexed and sliced the same way, and you can check if items exist.

```python
tuple1 = (1,2,3,4,5,6)
print(tuple1[0])    # prints 1
print(tuple1[1:3])  # prints (2,3)

if 4 in tuple1:
    print('The value 4 exists in the tuple')
```

### Modifying Tuples

You can't directly change a tuple. However, you can convert it to a list, modify the list, then convert the list back in to a tuple.

```python
tuple1 = (1,2,3,4,5,6)
list1 = list(tuple1)
list1.append(7)
tuple1 = tuple(list1)
print(tuple1)
```

Keep in mind, though, that tuples are not meant to be modified. Consider a different data structure if you find yourself needing to modify tuples.

### Iterating Over Tuples

Because tuples are an iterable, like lists, you can use the same for loops as lists.

```python
tuple1 = (1,2,3,4,5,6)
for value in tuple1:
    print(value)

for index in range(len(tuple1)):
    print(index, ":", tuple1[index])
```

### Lists Inside Tuples

Tuples can contain any object, just like lists. They can even contain lists and other tuples and those values can be indexed like anything else.

```python
tuple1 = (1, (2,3), [4,5,6])
print(tuple1[2])
```

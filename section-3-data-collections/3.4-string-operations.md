# 3.4 String Operations

### Immutability

Strings in Python are immutable. They cannot changed or updated. You can get the character of a string by indexing but if you try to set that index to a different value, Python throws an error.

```python
name = 'James Bond'
print(name[6]) # prints B

name[6] = 'P' # throws an error
```

### String Functions and Methods

The string object in Python includes many different methods to work with string data. Below is a list of the methods to know for the PCEP exam. All methods return new string objects.

| String Method | Description                                                |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| lower()       | Converts the string to lowercase                           |
| upper()       | Converts the string to uppercase                           |
| title()       | Converts the first character of each word to uppercase     |
| capitalize()  | Converts the first character to uppercase                  |
| replace()     | Replaces a substring with another                          |
| count()       | Returns the number of times a substring appears in string  |
| format()      | Used to print string containing placeholders and variables |

<pre class="language-python"><code class="lang-python"><strong>name = 'James Bond'
</strong>print(name.lower())                  # prints james bond
print(name.upper())                  # prints JAMES BOND
print(name.title())                  # prints James Bond
print(name.capitalize())             # prints James Bond
print(name.replace('ames', 'iminy')) # prints Jiminy Bond
print(name.count('J'))               # prints 1
print('Hello, {name}'.format(name='Joe')) # prints Hello, Joe</code></pre>

In addition to string methods, there are built-in Python functions that can work with strings too. You can index, get the length, get the type, concatenate strings and so on.

```python
name = 'James Bond'
first_name = 'Dr'
last_name = 'Evil'
print(name[0])                        # prints J
print(len(name))                      # prints 10
print(type(name))                     # prints <class 'str'>
print(first_name + ' ' + last_name)   # prints Dr Evil

hello = 'hello'
print(hello*3) # prints hellohellohello
```

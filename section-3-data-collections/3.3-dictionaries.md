# 3.3 Dictionaries

Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs. The keys are unique identifiers that map to their respective values.

Dictionaries are recognized by curly brackets and colons that separate the keys and values. Duplicate keys are not allowed. Retrieving values is as simple as referencing the key name within square brackets or by passing the key name into the get() method.

```python
user = {
    "name": "Peter Gibbons",
    "profession": "Software Engineer",
    "age": 28
}

print(user['age'])
print(user.get('name'))
```

Values can be changed by assigning a new value to the key. A new key and a new value are created if the key does not already exist.

```python
user = {
    "name": "Peter Gibbons",
    "profession": "Software Engineer",
    "age": 28
}
user["age"] += 1
user["drinks"] = "beer"
```

Keys must be a value with an immutable type. For example, lists cannot be used as keys but strings, numbers, and tuples can.

### Removing Items

You can delete keys and their values with the del keyword, which can also be used to delete the dictionary itself.

```python
user = {
    "name": "Peter Gibbons",
    "profession": "Software Engineer",
    "age": 28
}

del user["age"]
print(user)

del user
print(user)    # produces a NameError
```

Dictionaries contain pop() and popitem() methods for removing elements. The pop() method removes and returns the value specified by the key while the popitem() method removes and returns the last item in the dictionary.

Remove all the dictionary values with the clear() method.

```python
colors = {
    "red": 1,
    "white": 5,
    "blue": 2,
    "green": 9,
    "purple": 3
}

red_value = colors.pop('red')
last = colors.popitem()
print('Red value:', red_value)
print('Last:', last)

colors.clear()
print(colors)
```

### Iterating Keys and Values

Dictionaries includes useful methods for returning their keys and values.

| Method   | Description                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| keys()   | Returns a list of keys in the dictionary                     |
| values() | Returns a list of values in the dictionary                   |
| items()  | Returns a list of tuples containing both the keys and values |

```python
user = {
    "name": "Peter Gibbons",
    "profession": "Software Engineer",
    "age": 28
}
print(user.keys())

for key in user.keys():
    print(key)
    
for value in user.values():
    print(value)
    
for key, value in user.items():
    print(key, ":", value)
```

### Check If Key Exists

Python gives you a KeyError if you try to access a value with a key that doesn't exist. Check if a key exists before trying to access it.

```python
user = {
    "name": "Peter Gibbons",
    "profession": "Software Engineer",
    "age": 28
}

if "height" in user:
    print(user["height"])
else:
    print('The user dictionary does not contain a "height" key')
```

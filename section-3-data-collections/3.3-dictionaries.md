# 3.3 Dictionaries

Dictionaries store data in key:value pairs. They were originally unordered collections but were updated in Python 3.7 to ordered collections. They are recognized by curly brackets and colons separating keys and values. Duplicate keys are not allowed.

Retrieving values is as simple as referencing the key.

```python
user = {
    "name": "Peter Gibbons",
    "profession": "Software Engineer",
    "age": 28
}
print(user["age"])
```

Values can be changed by assigning a new value to the key. Adding new values happen when assigning new keys a new value.

```python
user = {
    "name": "Peter Gibbons",
    "profession": "Software Engineer",
    "age": 28
}
user["age"] += 1
user["drinks"] = "beer"
```

You can delete keys:values with the del keyword. It can also be used to delete the dictionary too.

```python
user = {
    "name": "Peter Gibbons",
    "profession": "Software Engineer",
    "age": 28
}
del user["age"]
print(user)
```

### Iterating Keys and Values

Dictionaries includes useful methods for iterating over its keys and values.

| Method   | Description                                                             |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| keys()   | Returns a list of keys found in the dictionary                          |
| values() | Returns a list of values found in the dictionary                        |
| items()  | Returns a list of tuples containing the keys and values of a dictionary |

```python
user = {
    "name": "Peter Gibbons",
    "profession": "Software Engineer",
    "age": 28
}
print(user.keys())

for key in user.keys():
    print(key)
    
for value in user.values():
    print(value)
    
for key, value in user.items():
    print(key, ":", value)
```

### Check If Key Exists

Python gives you a KeyError if you try to access a value with a key that doesn't exist. It would be a good idea to check if a key exists before trying to access it.

```python
user = {
    "name": "Peter Gibbons",
    "profession": "Software Engineer",
    "age": 28
}
if "height" in user:
    print(user["height"])
```

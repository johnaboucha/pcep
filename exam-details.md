# Exam Details

### Question Format

The PCEP exam consists of 30 questions. The questions are single and multiple-select questions, drag & drop, gap fill, sort, code fill, and code insertion. The question content is based on Python 3.

You have 40 minutes to complete the exam, which is more than plenty if you've studied the material.

### Proctored Versus Non-Proctored

The entry-level certification exam (PCEP-30-02) is delivered in proctored and non-proctored formats. The proctored mode is available at schools, universities and other organizations participating in the OpenEDG Education Partner Program.

The non-proctored mode is the default delivery format for those taking the exam online. Remote testing makes everything quick and easy. Online exam takers are asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to treat the exam material as confidential.

### Vouchers

Exam vouchers can be purchased by visiting the [PCEP](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcep) page on the Python Institute's website and clicking the Purchase Voucher button. The exam is non-proctored so you can take it online at anytime you feel ready.

Cost of the exam in 2022 is $59 USD.

# 4.2 More Functions

### Parameters vs. Arguments

Functions can receive arguments when they're called. These arguments can contain default parameters.

```python
def greet(name):
    print('Hello, ' + name)

greet('Zelda')


```

The order of arguments is important when functions receive more than one argument. These are called **positional arguments** and are set in the order they are received, except when you explicitly define them in your function call. If you pass in more positional arguments than expected, Python throws an error.

```python
def divide(x, y):
    return x/y

print(divide(4,2))      # prints 2.0
print(divide(2,4))      # prints 0.5
print(divide(x=4, y=2)) # prints 2.0
print(divide(2,4,8))    # throws an error; the function can only take 2 arguments
```

You can define **default parameters** in your function definition. However, they must be placed after non-default arguments or Python will throw an error.

```python
def say_hi(greeting, name='buddy'):
    return greeting + ', ' + name + '!'
    
print(say_hi('Hi')) # prints Hi, buddy!

def say_hello(name='buddy', greeting):    # throws an error,
    return greeting + ', ' + name + '!'   # non-default argument follows 
                                          # default argument
print(say_hello('Hi'))
```

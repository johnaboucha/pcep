### Function Arguments

Functions can be defined to receive arguments. These arguments might contain default values that are used when the function call doesn't include them.

```python
def say_hi(name):
    print('Hello, ' + name)

def greet(name='buddy!'):
    print('Hello, ' + name)

greet('Zelda')
greet()
say_hi() # produces a TypeError; the positional argument is missing
```

The order of arguments is important. These **positional arguments** are set in the order they are received unless specified differently in the function call. If you pass in more positional arguments than expected, Python throws a TypeError.

```python
def divide(x, y):
    return x/y

print(divide(4,2))      # prints 2.0
print(divide(2,4))      # prints 0.5
print(divide(y=2, x=4)) # prints 2.0
print(divide(2,4,8))    # produces a TypeError
```

As mentioned, you can also define arguments with **default values** in your function definition. However, they must be placed after positional arguments or Python will throw an error.

```python
def say_hi(greeting, name='buddy'):
    return greeting + ', ' + name + '!'
    
print(say_hi('Hi')) # prints Hi, buddy!

def say_hello(name='buddy', greeting):    # throws an error,
    return greeting + ', ' + name + '!'   # non-default argument follows 
                                          # default argument
print(say_hello('Hi'))
```

# 4.1 Functions

### Define Functions

Create your own functions to make code reusable. You cannot invoke a function before you define it. A best practice is to organize your functions to be at the top of your file.

```python
def greet():
    print('Hello, World!')
    
greet() # prints Hello, World!

shout() # throws and error because the function has not yet been defined

def shout():
    print('Yeeee HAAAAWWWWW!!!')
```

Functions always return a value. If it's not explicitly stated, a function returns the **None value**.

```python
def get_age():
    return 24
    
print(get_age()) # prints 24
```

### Recursion

Recursion happens when a function is used to call itself. Certain problems can be solved more easily by using recursion but you have to be careful of not creating an infinite loop in which the script fails to end. An If-statement is typically used to stop the recursion and return a base value.

One common example used to demonstrate recursion is with factorials. For instance, the factorial of 5 is denoted as 5! and is calculated with multiplication: 5\*4\*3\*2\*1.

```python
def calculate_factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * calculate_factorial(n-1)

print(calculate_factorial(5))
```

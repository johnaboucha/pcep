# Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer - Study Guide

_Written by John Boucha_

### Introduction

This study guide helps prepare beginner and experienced programmers for the **PCEP - Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer** certification issued by the Python Institute. The content of this guide is organized to match the PCEP-30-02 [exam syllabus](https://pythoninstitute.org/assets/627e61bc29de3989767095.pdf) and its four sections:

1. Computer Programming and Python Fundamentals
2. Control Flow – Conditional Blocks and Loops
3. Data Collections – Tuples, Dictionaries, Lists, and Strings
4. Functions and Exceptions

This guide also provides practice questions to test your Python knowledge and exam tips to help ensure you pass the exam on the first try. The guide assumes you have basic programming experience and you know how to run Python code on your computer or in an online editor.

Studying for the PCEP exam is like studying for any other exam. Take your time. Engage in the material. And make studying a part of your daily routine. Commit yourself to it. Read through the guide. Then, read through it again, carefully, working through each section with a code editor open to practice the concepts. Doing all this will leave you very well prepared.

Good luck!

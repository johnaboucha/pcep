# Introduction

This study guide prepares beginner and experienced programmers for the **PCEP - Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer** certification issued by the Python Institute. The content and structure of the guide aligns with the PCEP-30-02 [exam syllabus](https://pythoninstitute.org/assets/627e61bc29de3989767095.pdf).

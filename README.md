# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

This study guide prepares beginner and experienced programmers for the **PCEP - Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer** certification issued by the Python Institute. The content and structure of this guide aligns with the PCEP-30-02 [exam syllabus](https://pythoninstitute.org/assets/627e61bc29de3989767095.pdf).

This guide also includes practice questions and exam tips to help ensure you pass the exam on the first try.

It is assumed you have previous experience with Python and know how to run code on your computer, in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/try), or on some other platform.

### Exam Format

The PCEP exam consists of 30 questions. The questions are single and multiple-select questions, drag & drop, gap fill, sort, code fill, and code insertion. You have 40 minutes to complete the exam, which is more than plenty if you've studied the material.

Vouchers

Exam vouchers can be purchased by visiting the [PCEP](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcep) page on the Python Institute's website and clicking the Purchase Voucher button. The exam is non-proctored so you can take it online at anytime you feel ready.
